## What is The Icarus Project?

From 2002-2020 The Icarus Project developed a network of peer support groups and
a creative media outlet that provided a home for folks who experience mental
health struggles and feel alienated by society. It normalized discussion of
altered states, intense emotional distress, and suicidality and fostered
solidarity among people with experiences that were often diagnosed as “serious
mental illness”. While it mostly stayed off the radar of the mainstream, at its
height The Icarus Project had tens of thousands of forum community members, many
dozens of local support/mutual aid groups, and has left a legacy of ideas and
visions with its multiple creative publications that are still compelling in the
present day.

The Icarus Project’s [original mission/vision statement](/articles/mission-2005)
was a rallying cry to reimagine the way we think about mental differences. The
vision opened up a lot of space for thinking about personal and social change.
The online discussion boards hosted thousands of creative weirdos and visionary
social justice activists. It provided a framework for dozens of mutual aid peer
support groups in cities across North America and around the world.

We built this archive website to inspire a new generation of mad people and
their allies to be inspired and engaged by these ideas and traditions.

## What Happened to The Icarus Project?

While The Icarus Project officially existed until 2020, there were major changes
beginning in 2015 that shifted the priorities of the organization. As a project
that grew out of radical leftist/anarchist counter culture, one of the critiques
of the Icarus Project was that its leadership were majority white and middle
class. There were critiques that the mental health issues of the global
majority: Black, indigenous and people of color were being ignored because of
privilege. The original founders, Jacks and Sascha, both envisioned Icarus
growing to have a leadership that could outgrow their leadership. The idea that
Icarus should recenter the most economically and socially marginalized led to
what was called a “Decolonization” process of Icarus. The history of the
organization is well documented in Erica Fletcher’s dissertation
[Mad Together in Technogenic Times](/articles/mad-together).

The new group of Icaristas prioritized content for the QTBIPOC community and
embraced the vision of [Healing Justice](https://healingjusticeproject.org/).

There’s also good documentation of the project from the 10th anniversary in 2012.

## What's This Website?

In 2015 the old Icarus website was taken offline and much of the old content
disappeared publicly from the internet. Last year Nick Bosman found an old hard
drive with a version of the website from 2012. Then David Nishizaki found a copy
on the old Mayfirst hosting site along with an old copy of the phpbb forums.

Both of them are pretty messy with lots of dead links, but they’re also filled
with really powerful writing and art, documenting an online and in-person
community that touched many, many lives. We decided to take some of our
favorite content and make it more accessible

## What's the Future of Icarus?

We decided to make this archive website in the hopes that it will lay the
foundation for a new peer support community.
