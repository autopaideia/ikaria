## Abstract

“Psychiatric Disability and Rhetoricity: Refiguring Rhetoric and Composition
Studies in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century” examines the ways in which mental health
activists in the consumer/survivor/ex-patient (c/s/x) movement reframe medical
models of mental illness by asserting their lived experience as valuable
ontology. I use a mixed qualitative research methodology to analyze discussion
board posts and vernacular videos as well as data from interviews I conducted
with c/s/x activists. Seeking to correct the absence in rhetoric and composition
of first-person perspectives from psychiatric disabled people, I demonstrate how
disability studies provides a position from which the rhetorical agency of
psychiatrically disabled people can be established.

In Chapter 1, “Naming Psychiatric Disability and Moving Beyond the Ethos
Problem,” I contextualize the absence of psychiatric disabled perspectives in
the history of rhetoric. By demonstrating that the logic of
psychiatric-disability-as-an-ethos-problem functions as an enthymeme that
warrants re-examination, I denaturalize discourses that assume psychiatrically
disabled rhetors have ethos problems. An interchapter follows Chapter 1, and
provides an overview of Chapters 2-5 and my mixed, emergent qualitative research
methodology.

In my second chapter, “Interactivity and Rhetorical Ownership: The Icarus
Project Discussion Board Posts,” I analyze the collaborative creation of a “mad
vocabulary” taking place on an active discussion forum within a c/s/x community
called the Icarus Project. Using grounded theory methods, I coded over 2,000
discussion board posts written over a span of ten years. Using this data, I
demonstrate how individuals participating in the Icarus Project online draw on
lived experience to claim “rhetorical ownership” over labels (Sontag 93).
Chapter 3, “Vernacular Videos as Performances of Recovery: MindFreedom
International’s <cite>I Got Better</cite> Project,” forges new ways of including
psychiatrically disabled people in rhetoric and composition, and it does so by
analyzing critical incidents within a collection of personal stories titled
<cite>I Got Better</cite> that discuss recovery from psychiatric disabilities. I
theorize stories from within the c/s/x movement function as
<em>performances of recovery</em>, which contribute situated knowledge to the
public discussion of mental health treatment and encourage identification with
various audiences.

In Chapter 4, “Constructing a Counterpublic: C/s/x Participants and Leaders
Reflect on Alternative Communities” I analyze interviews that I conducted with
six c/s/x activists and/or allies. This chapter adds depth to my analyses in
Chapters 2 and 3 of c/s/x activists’ online rhetorical practices by uncovering
the benefits of online communities from users’ perspectives. Although online
c/s/x communities are publicly accessible and talk back to dominant cultural
understandings of mental illness, these interviewees cite personal connections
with peers as the main benefit of participation in online communities. I
characterize online c/s/x communities as a counterpublic that embraces
disability as a defining attribute of the online environment.

My concluding chapter, “Creating Institutional Change by Moving Beyond the Ethos
Problem: Pedagogical, Administrative, and Professional Implications,”
synthesizes the findings from my research and imagines pedagogies, research
projects, and administrative approaches that are designed by and for
psychiatrically disabled people. I ultimately argue that first-person
perspectives of psychiatrically disabled people are necessary for changing
attitudes and professional practices.
