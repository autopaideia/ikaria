**Abstract** Over the past 12 years, I’ve had the good fortune of collaborating
with others to create a project which challenges and complicates the dominant
biopsychiatric model of mental illness. The Icarus Project, founded in 2002, not
only critiqued the terms and practices central to the biopsychiatric model, it
also inspired a new language and a new community for people struggling with
mental health issues in the 21st century. The Icarus Project believes that
humans are meaning makers, that meaning is created through developing
intrapersonal and interpersonal narratives, and that these narratives are
important sites of creativity, struggle, and growth. The Icarus counter
narrative and the community it fostered has been invaluable for people around
the world dealing with psychic diversity—particularly for people alienated by
mainstream approaches. But, despite the numbers of people who have been inspired
by this approach, the historical background of the Icarus Project is hard to
find. It exists primarily in oral history, newspaper articles, unpublished or
self-published Icarus documents, and in internet discussion forums. As the
co-founder of the Icarus Project, I use this article to make my understanding of
that history and its key documents more widely available.

## Emergence of the icarus project

In September of 2002, I wrote an article for the _San Francisco Bay Guardian_
that was read by thousands of people entitled “The Bipolar World” (DuBrul). It
was about my personal struggles in the mental health system, the biopsychiatric
model that dominates it, and my desire for a new way of looking at my diagnosis
of “bipolar disorder.” I was 27 years old and had been writing stories and
articles for years within my insular community of punks and anarchists, but this
was the first time that my words had made it into a more mainstream publication.
It was also the most personal article I had ever written with details about
dramatic hospitalizations, psychotic delusions, and struggles with suicidal
depression.

I wrote about how at times I felt like the entire universe was crawling under my
skin, and yet at other times, I felt as though I had been given a divine mission
to save the world. Then I wrote about how the medications I was taking actually
seemed to be helping me, but how distrustful I was of the medical model. I was
concerned with how closely it seemed to be tied to the capitalist system and
with how confusing and alienating the whole situation left me feeling. I ended
the story by saying:

> But I feel so alienated sometimes, even by the language I find coming out of
> my mouth or that I type out on the computer screen. Words like “disorder,”
> “disease,” and “dysfunction” just seem so very hollow and crude. I feel like
> I’m speaking a foreign and clinical language that is useful for navigating my
> way though the current system but doesn’t translate into my own internal
> vocabulary, where things are so much more fluid and complex...
>
> In the end, what it comes down to for me is that I desperately feel the need
> to connect with other folks like myself so I can validate my experiences and
> not feel so damn alone in the world, so I can pass along the lessons I’ve
> learned to help make it easier for other people struggling like myself. By my
> nature and the way I was raised, I don’t trust mainstream medicine or
> corporate culture, but the fact that I’m sitting here writing this essay right
> now is proof that their drugs are helping me. And I’m looking for others out
> there with similar experiences.
>
> Our society still seems to be in the early stages of the dialogue where you’re
> either “for” or “against” the mental health system. Like either you swallow
> the antidepressant ads on television as modern-day gospel and start giving
> your dog Prozac, or you’re convinced we’re living in Brave New World and all
> the psych drugs are just part of a big conspiracy to keep us from being
> self-reliant and realizing our true potential. I think it’s really about time
> we start carving some more of the middle ground with stories from outside the
> mainstream and creating a new language for ourselves that reflects all the
> complexity and brilliance that we hold
> inside. (DuBrul, Sascha Altman 2002)

Within 2 days of the article going to print, my inbox was filled with email from
people who had read the story and related somehow to my words. I never would
have imagined that my story would have resonated with so many others from
different communities and lifestyles, and it was an incredibly empowering
feeling. For the first time in my life, I learned the important lesson that when
you are brave enough to tell your own story, other people often feel compelled
to tell you their story as well. I learned about the liberatory power of
speaking our personal truths and about the power of personal narratives to
challenge the power of the dominant narrative.

One of the people who initially wrote to me with a particularly compelling story
was a person named Jacks McNamara. We began corresponding over email, met
shortly thereafter, and within the span of an evening and a morning decided to
create a place for people like us who had been through the mental health system
and were diagnosed with bipolar disorder to tell their stories. We started with
a website, calling it the Icarus Project. Shortly after meeting, we wrote an
initial vision statement:

> As the ancient Greek myth is told, the young boy Icarus and his inventor
> father Daedalus were imprisoned in a maze on an island and trying to escape.
> Daedalus was crafty and made them both pairs of wings built carefully out of
> wax and feathers, but warned Icarus not to fly too close to the blazing sun or
> his wings would fall to pieces. Icarus, being young and foolish, was so
> intoxicated with his new ability to fly that he soared too high, the delicate
> wings melted and burned, and he fell into the deep blue ocean and drowned.
> For countless generations, the story of Icarus’ wings has served to remind us
> that we are humans rather than gods, and that sometimes the most incredible of
> gifts can also be the most dangerous.
>
> The Icarus Project was created in the beginning of the 21st century by a group
> of people diagnosed in the contemporary language as Bipolar or
> Manic-Depressive. Defining ourselves outside convention we see our condition
> as a dangerous gift to be cultivated and taken care of rather than as a
> disease or disorder needing to be ‘cured.’ With this double edged blessing we
> have the ability to fly to places of great vision and creativity, but like the
> boy Icarus, we also have the potential to fly dangerously close to the
> sun—into realms of delusion and psychosis—and crash in a blaze of fire and
> confusion. At our heights we may find ourselves capable of creating music,
> art, words, and inventions which touch people’s souls and change the course of
> history. At our depths we may end up alienated and alone, incarcerated in
> psychiatric institutions, or dead by our own hands.
>
> Despite these risks, we recognize the intertwined threads of madness and
> creativity as tools of inspiration and hope in this repressed and damaged
> society. We understand that we are members of a group that has been
> misunderstood and persecuted throughout history, but has also been responsible
> for some of its most brilliant creations. And we are proud.
>
> While many of us use mood-stabilizing drugs like Lithium to regulate and
> dampen the extremes of our manias and the hopeless depths of our depressions,
> others among us have learned how to control the mercurial nature of our moods
> through diet, exercise, and spiritual focus. Many of us make use of
> non-Western practices such as Chinese medicine, Yoga, and meditation. Often we
> find that we can handle ourselves better when we channel our tremendous energy
> into creation: some of us paint murals and write books, some of us convert
> diesel cars to run on vegetable oil and make gardens that are nourished with
> the waste water from our showers. In our own ways we’re all struggling to

> the true potential that lies between brilliance and madness.
> (The Icarus Project 2002)

Thus, very early on in our work together, Jacks and I developed a counter
narrative to the dominant biopsychiatric narrative. We spoke clearly of our
desire not for a reduction of stigma or a cure for our disease but for a new
culture and language of mental health. We considered the mainstream narrative to
be a reductionist framework offered by the current mental health establishment,
and we emphasized our desire to step outside that framework and into new
territory.

We talked about our biodiesel cars and graywater systems, which represented our
countercultural values and alternative knowledge; our stories about painting
murals and writing books highlighted the role art and creativity would play in
shaping our work. Our narrative, which recognized both lithium and yoga as
equally valid means to handling our sensitivities, opened up a much needed space
in the dialog about self-care and mental health. We recognized the intertwined
threads of madness and creativity as tools of inspiration and hope in a
repressed and damaged society. We linked madness and creativity, speaking of
them as “tools of inspiration.” Even more powerfully, we flipped the script and
pointed our fingers back at the society in which we were raised. Furthermore, we
expressed an understanding that we are members of a group that has been
misunderstood and persecuted throughout history but that has also been
responsible for some of its most brilliant creations. It was a powerful
beginning.

## Narrative strands of our new story

Before going further with the Icarus Story, let me step back to provide some
context. Our response to the label “bipolar” was not a “normal” response, which
is why the Icarus Project brought a new perspective to psychic diversity. To
create this perspective, we drew inspiration from many social movements and
subcultural communities that came before us. So even though our response was
unusual, it did not arise in a vacuum. In creating the Icarus Project, we wove
together the ideas and practices in these movements to imagine a powerful new
counter narrative to the dominant mental health narrative that went beyond a
questioning of the language around “bipolar” and critiqued the system itself. A
review of our cultural, social, and political roots places our work in a larger
context and adds to the richness and depth of the Icarus Project as a whole. It
also articulates the world views and ways of life from which Icarus emerged.
These worldviews are not in the mainstream, they are not “normal,” but they have
a long history of solidarity behind them. Although there are surely more, I have
identified eight social, political, cultural, and ecological movements that most
notably inspired the Icarus Project. Some of these movements were very conscious
to us, some were just part of the cultural background in which we lived.

### Anarchism

For nearly three centuries, anarchists were at the forefront of contending
undemocratic, unaccountable forms of power. From the Spanish Civil War to the
1960s counterculture, anarchist ideas and actions have played an important role
in political and social movements (Marshall 2010). Since the end of the Cold War
in 1989, there has been a resurgence in anarchist organizing, most notably
during the protests against the World Trade Organization in the streets of
Seattle 1999 (Graeber 2002). Many early Icarus participants identified with the
anarchist political tradition and its emphasis on prefigurative political
ideals, mutual aid, and direct action. Our original organizing vision was based
on Food Not Bombs (Butler and McHenry 2002), an anarchist project which began as
part of the anti-nuclear movement and is a type of direct action and mutual aid:
acquiring free food, cooking it as a group, and serving it in a public place.

### Anti-psychiatry

Though we did not fully understand it in the early days, we were walking in the
footsteps of a large body of knowledge and thought from the 1960s, grouped under
the category of Anti-Psychiatry (Cooper 1967). Anti-psychiatry is a term used
to refer to a configuration of groups and theoretical constructs that question
the fundamental assumptions and practices of psychiatry, such as its claim that
it achieves universal, scientific objectivity. In the United States, the body of
ideas known as anti-psychiatry were passed down and put into practice in what
became known as the Psychiatric Survivors Movement by organizations such as
Mindfreedom International based in Eugene, Oregon (Glasser 2008). While the
Icarus Project had much in common with this project, we tended to have a more
nuanced relationship to psychiatric medications than many in the survivor
movement. Also, we were younger than most in the survivor movement and had never
experienced long-term hospitalizations or institutionalization. That set us
apart and made us more appealing to many of our generation who had emergency
room and short-term hospital run-ins with the psychiatric establishment typical
of today.

### Permaculture/sustainable ecology

From the beginning, the vision and spirit of the Icarus Project drew a great
deal of inspiration from the worlds of sustainable agriculture and the body of
knowledge collectively referred to as Permaculture (Mollison 1997). Within the
first months of its formation, both Jacks and I were working on Community
Supported Agriculture (CSA) farms, understanding that our sensitivities (labeled
by society as “bipolar disorder”) could be kept in check by keeping close to the
earth and prioritizing the cultivation of food in a community context. Both an
economic farming model and an international movement, CSA re-prioritizes the
relationship between farmers, the food that they grow and the families that
consume their products. Icarus has always had a culture that prioritizes and
celebrates food. Many of the most powerful metaphors in the Icarus Project are
drawn from ecology and sustainable agriculture: from roots and seeds to the
comparison of monoculture fields with monocultures of the mind.

Permaculture refers to a set of principles for developing sustainable human
systems by mimicking systems that occur in nature (Mollison 1997). Among the
useful ideas in permaculture are: using and valuing diversity, using small and
slow solutions; integrating rather than segregating, understanding the important
relationship between the wild and the cultivated, understanding that the problem
holds the keys to the solution, catching and storing energy, and stepping back
to observe patterns in nature and society. Like the Icarus Project, Permaculture
has gone from a set of ideas and principles gathered from a diverse group of
people and places to an action oriented international signifier for a thriving
movement.

### LGBTQ movement

The Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Queer (LGTBQ) movement is large and
diverse; within it there is an incredible amount of outsider and resistance
stories that have inspired the work of the Icarus Project. The watershed event
for both the radical and mainstream LGBTQ community was the 1969 Stonewall riots
in New York City where, for the first time, an LGBTQ community publicly reacted
militantly in the face of oppression in a way that was widely reported (Duberman
1994). Until 1973 homosexuality was on the American Psychiatric Association’s
official list of mental disorders. (Bayer 1987). In the 1980s, an organization
called ACTUP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) coordinated an incredibly
successful campaign to raise awareness about government complicity in the AIDS
crisis and build a successful movement based around direct action activist
culture and queer identity (Shepard & Hayduk, 2002). Icarus has drawn a lot of
inspiration from the success of the radical portions of the Queer Pride
movement.

What we have in common is the focus on personal politics, looking at a
marginalized identity and reclaiming it as a point of pride. Icarus members’
common shouts of “mad pride” (Glasser 2008) have much in common with the loud
and vibrant articulation of gay pride or queer pride. It helps that many of the
early (and contemporary) Icarus organizers identify as some shade of queer. At
the heart of our connection is the utilization of pride around an oppressed
identity to inspire political action and the understanding that when we stop
being afraid of being exposed for a shamed identity, there is nothing that can
stop us.

### Harm reduction

The harm reduction movement is centered in the experiences of drug users, sex
workers, people involved in street economies, and criminalized communities.
There are many ways to frame the war on drugs in the United States and many
ideological angles from which to view it; one angle is that it has been a
massive and successful propaganda exercise to demonize drug users and
destabilize Black and brown communities. Drug users are first criminalized for
using outlawed substances, and then, as a result of how they must obtain drugs,
forced to engage in additional criminal behavior in order to maintain their
habits and addictions. Thus, a drug user becomes a deviant - a transgressor who
is incompetent and selfish, destined for jails, institutions or death. The
message is that drug users do not care about their own health, the health of
their friends or colleagues and certainly not the greater public health. The
harm reduction movement challenges these ideas.

At the core of the harm reduction movement is the belief that everyone has the
right to determine the circumstances of his or her own life, including care
(Inciardi & Harrison 2000). This principle is also at the core of the Icarus
Project. Early in our visioning, we embraced the complexities of our individual
members’ relationship to psychiatric medications, use of recreational
substances, life style choices and outsider identities. One of our first website
forums was titled “Give Me Lithium or Give Me Meth,” and it was a place to share
stories about members relationships to illegal drugs. The Icarus Project
embraced the spirit of the harm reduction movement in its publishing of the
_Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs_ (Hall 2007), which
gathered the best information and valuable lessons we could find about reducing
and coming off of psychiatric medication.

### Global justice movement

From the beginning, the Icarus Project viewed itself in terms of a larger
political context, as one part of a struggle for mutual liberation. The Global
Justice Movement describes the loose collection of individuals and groups—often
referred to as a movement of movements— placing a significant emphasis on
transnational solidarity uniting activists in the global South and global North.
Usually traced historically to the Zapatista Uprising in Chiapas, Mexico on
January 1, 1994, the Global Justice Movement is an anti-capitalist movement that
weaves together the struggles of many movements, including an emphasis on
grassroots organizing, popular education, and strong critique of capitalism
(Notes from Nowhere, 2003). Our original web designer was from Indymedia, one of
the key online activist networks in the early part of the 21st century and a hub
of the Global Justice Movement. Not long after we published our first book,
_Navigating the Space Between Brilliance and Madness_, we learned that it was
being read widely in the Zapatista activist community of San Cristobal de las
Casas, Chiapas, Mexico.

### Counterculture

In 1968, Theodore Roszak coined the term “counterculture” to refer to the
intersection of Vietnam War protesters, dropouts, and rebels of various stripes
who had an effect on the larger dominant culture (1968). In the 1960s, the
counterculture was strong in numbers and cultural influence. Today, many of the
most powerful ideas have either been co-opted in the service of capitalism or
marginalized. Countercultural ideas are transmitted through music and art, and
they offer creative ways of disseminating ideas, connecting with allies and
realizing goals. The following is a brief mention of some of the countercultures
that have inspired the Icarus Project via their ideologies, practices,
approaches and goals.

The _Beat Generation_ is a term used to describe a group of American post-WWII
writers who came to prominence in the 1950s, as well as the cultural phenomena
that they both documented and inspired (Charters 2003). Central elements of Beat
culture included experimentation with drugs and alternative forms of sexuality,
an interest in Eastern religion, a rejection of materialism, and the idealizing
of exuberant means of expression and being (Charters 2003). _Howl_, written by
Allen Ginsburg in 1956, chronicles the repressive culture of America in the
1950s. It reads as a transmission from an earlier time in a language that has
clearly influenced the nature of our modern slang-filled English. _Howl_ was
dedicated to Carl Solomon, whom Ginsburg befriended in a Rockland County
psychiatric hospital. The following excerpt captures an aspect of the Beat
culture that has influenced the Icarus Project in major ways: “I’m with you in
Rockland/where there are twenty five thousand mad comrades all together singing
the final stanzas of the Internationale...” (Ginsburg 1956, 18) The weaving
together of madness and the history of leftist politics is familiar. The words
are not mainstream but are transmissions from the underground to the
underground—now in the mainstream for everyone to see.

Jack Kerouac was the archetypal beat writer – the explorer of the open roads of
America. One of the most famous quotes from his influential book On the Road
articulates the feeling of the Beats and their relationship to the “mad”:

> The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to
> talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who
> never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous
> yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle
> you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes “Awww!” (1957, 21)

We consciously resurrected this Beat language in the Icarus Project, referring
affectionately to one another as “mad ones,” the nod to earlier times and
cultures that contributed to the artistic foundation of our project.

### Punk rock

As one of the founders of the Icarus Project, I can safely say that the culture
of punk rock held a critical and important role in our project’s tone and
vision. Emerging in the 1970s in London and New York before spreading to cities
over the globe, punk rock was initially a reaction to the sterile conformity of
commercial rock and roll and disco culture. It inspired a lot of creative
protest music during the Reagan and Thatcher era of the 1980s. An emphasis on
questioning authority, rebellious distrust of government, and an
anti-materialistic DIY (Do It Yourself) ethic. The British version of punk had
direct influences from the Situationists, a clever revolutionary student
movement from the 1960s in Paris (Marcus 1989). The Situationists were
proto-punks, inspired by the ideas of breaking down barriers imposed by modern
capitalist society and creating “situations” where new visions might emerge.
Woven into the ideology of punk is an understanding that society is sick and
that acting crazy is totally natural. Growing up immersed in the punk scene in
New York in the 1990s, I learned how to be proud of sometimes feeling crazy and,
if anything, learned to revel in it while celebrating difference and
nonconformity.

The story of punk, and of countercultures generally, are useful in explaining an
important aspect of the cultural vision and strategy of the Icarus Project. In
1994, punk went through a revival in the mainstream with the rise in popularity
of bands like Nirvana and Green Day. I watched the subculture in which I had
been immersed suddenly become currency for mass culture with both positive and
negative results. One positive result was that more people had the opportunity
to be exposed to the alternative political and social messages by which punk
rock music is characterized. On the negative side, capitalist consumer culture’s
process of marketing a product required that many of the themes of social change
be toned down or altogether removed from the music (Frank 1997). As a result,
the counternarrative associated with punk rock culture was somewhat diluted. For
Icarus, this history meant that important cultural work can start in the
underground, but at the same time, this work can easily become co-opted.

## Navigating the space between brilliance and madness

Pulling these many strands together, the Icarus Project initially focused on the
identity narratives of bipolar disorder, and much of our language was geared
towards radical political activists. But it quickly became clear that our
message was reaching people outside of the counterculture from which we were
born. Shortly after the website went live in November 2002, I embarked on a
cross-country tour in a beat-up 1982 Toyota pickup truck, facilitating workshops
in community spaces and collective house kitchens. I had never organized mental
health discussions, but I had facilitated a lot of meetings and taught
permaculture and seed saving workshops. I was used to public speaking and
creating space for dialog, but nothing like this. I started with a basic set of
questions which evolved into some incredible discussions. An example of the way
in which we used our words to carve out a space in the psychic architecture of
the community around us is illustrated in the following passage, an excerpt from
the original flier used to advertise the meetings and gatherings of the Icarus
Project:

> ### Walking the edge of insanity
>
> #### Navigating the world of mental health as a radical in the 21st century
>
> As creative folks skeptical of the conventional social system, what does it
> mean within our extended community for someone to be “mentally ill” or
> struggling with traditional labels such as “clinical depression,” “bipolar
> disorder,” or “schizophrenia?” How helpful is the modern psychiatric paradigm
> that revolves around medicine and mental disorders and how much of it is
> really just a function of powerful pharmaceutical corporations, public funding
> cuts, and a society that equates productivity with health? Are there other
> frameworks for understanding what it means to be “crazy?” Are there
> alternative ways to heal? How do we begin the process?
>
> Chances are pretty high that if you’re reading this, you or someone you care
> about has been grappling with these questions for years. Come join an open
> discussion and learn more about The Icarus Project, a radical support network
> by and for people struggling with the dangerous gifts commonly labeled as
> mental illnesses. The Icarus Project envisions a new culture and language that
> resonates with our actual experiences rather than trying to fit our lives into
> a conventional framework. By joining together as individuals and as a
> community, we hope to create space where the intertwined threads of madness
> and creativity can inspire hope and transformation in a repressed and damaged
> world. (The Icarus Project 2006)

The following season, Jacks and I were both apprenticing on organic farms, she
in California and me in the Hudson Valley of New York. The Icarus Project
website was up and running, and a virtual community began to evolve around the
discussion forums. We were attracting interesting people, creating discussion
forums with names like _“Alternate Dimensions or Psychotic Delusions”_ and
_“Experiencing Madness and Extreme States.”_ There was no place else where
people who used psych meds and people who did not, people who identified with
diagnostic categories and people who did not, could all talk with each other and
share stories. Because of the outreach in the anarchist and activist community,
there was a high percentage of creative people with a radical political
analysis. And with the (seeming) anonymity of the Internet, people felt
comfortable being honest and sharing intimate stories about their lives. Our
website served as a refuge for a diverse group of people who were learning the
ways in which new narratives could be woven about their lives.

After a generous and serendipitous donation (from a wealthy woman whose daughter
was diagnosed with bipolar disorder) in the winter of 2003, Jacks and I reunited
and spent two intense months compiling the writings of people on the website
with our own writings into a book that we self-published under the title:
_Navigating the Space Between Brilliance and Madness – A Reader and Roadmap of Bipolar World_.
Here is a passage from the introduction:

> The two people putting together this reader you hold in your hands have been
> diagnosed with “Bipolar Disorder,” the most recent medical language for what
> was once known as Manic Depression. It is considered a disease of the mind.
> The statistics are that 6 million people in the United States have some form
> of the disorder, and that 1 out of 5 people left untreated will eventually
> kill themselves. But this “illness” is more than a bunch of statistics, or a
> set of symptoms. For those of us who live with this awkward label, the
> phenomenon it describes is something fluid and hard to pin down, yet none of
> us can escape its effects on our lives. We share common patterns and eerily
> common stories, some devastating and some inspiring—and so few of them have
> actually been mapped...
>
> In this little book we’ve assembled an atlas of maps, back and forth through
> the subconscious and consciousness, from hospital waiting rooms to collective
> house kitchens, from the desert to the supermarket. The pages we are giving to
> you chart some of the underground tunnels beneath the mainstream medical model
> of treatment, tunnels carved by brave and visionary people before us, and
> tunnels we’re helping to carve ourselves with our friends. They go beyond
> three dimensions. They are maps made up of ideas and stories and examples from
> many people’s lives. They are maps of our souls as well as the world outside.
> Some of these maps will help you to navigate through the existing architecture
> of the mental health establishment; some of them might help you figure out for
> yourself where you stand in relation to the larger ecosystem of the earth and
> the people who inhabit it.

After this publication, The Icarus Project grew in earnest. Our website became
increasingly well know; our book was in its third printing; and we had completed
three incredibly successful tours. Our Icarus discourse of dangerous gifts was
becoming audible among the larger community around us, despite our subcultural
backgrounds and unorthodox messages, we were onto something that people found
compelling. We had tapped into a desperate need for a more creative look at
mental health and wellness. The biopsychiatric model, though incredibly
profitable for some, left many of us out in the cold as far as understanding our
mental health issues and how they related to the rest of the world.

Through contacts in the non-profit funding world, Jacks and I met with Anthony
Wood, Executive Director of the Ittleson Foundation, and talked over ideas for a
proposal to partner with an older, more established organization in New York
named Fountain House to do outreach on college campuses. A radical mental health
organization when it was founded in the 1940s, Fountain House became the parent
of an international network of mental health Clubhouses (the International
Center for Clubhouse Development.) Like most mental health agencies, Fountain
House uses the traditional language of mental illness, but also, like most
mental health agencies, they were desperate for ideas that could attract young
people. Below is a section from our proposal to the Ittleson Foundation:

> Community support is a vitally important part of the healing process no matter
> what form of treatment an individual chooses. While there are numerous
> conventional support structures available for adults, family members, and
> those who are comfortable with the medical model of mental illness, there are
> very few peer-based support structures created by and for young and creative
> populations. Most of the support structures currently available in this
> country have been established by institutions, mental health professionals,
> and large bureaucratic organizations like NAMI, the National Alliance for the
> Mentally Ill. While these groups have indubitably helped thousands of people
> suffering from mental illness, they have also alienated countless individuals
> who do not ”identify with the conventional paradigm of the “mental health
> consumer.” The majority of our members have indicated that they did not
> consider any of the participants in traditional support groups to be their
> peers, and subsequently felt even more alone in their struggles to understand
> the extremes of their experience.
>
> Traditional support organizations frequently speak in terms of “psychiatric
> disability,” “disease,” and “eradicating mental illness” (the first objective
> in NAMI’s mission statement). The members of The Icarus Project, by contrast,
> have consistently expressed that our project – with its unique conception of
> mental illness as a potential gift of great vision, creativity, and compassion
> that must be harnessed and respected, as well as an incredible hardship – is
> one of the only places where they can find meaningful support from true peers.
> The archetype of the mythical Icarus, who uses the gift of wings to fly to
> places of incredible beauty but crashes after recklessly flying too close to
> the sun, has proven a much more resonant metaphor for our members’ extremes of
> experience than the paradigm of disease...(The Icarus Project 2004)

The day we found out we had received the grant from Ittleson, we were hanging
the first Icarus Project art show at a radical community center/art gallery on
the Lower East Side of New York known as ABC No Rio. It was surreal; not only
were they giving us $80,000 to work on our dream project, but we had also
stepped suddenly into a world of legitimacy to which we never expected to gain
access. Within 6 months of receiving the grant, we recruited a handful of
amazing organizers, collectivized our organization, and revised our mission and
vision statements to reflect our evolving political and social analysis. In
short, this was the statement, not just of a non-profit but of an aspiring
movement:

### Icarus project mission statement (2005)

#### OUR MISSION

The Icarus Project envisions a new culture and language that resonates with our
actual experiences of ’mental illness’ rather than trying to fit our lives into
a conventional framework. We are a network of people living with and/or
affected by experiences that are often diagnosed and labeled as psychiatric
conditions. We believe these experiences are dangerous gifts needing cultivation
and care, rather than diseases or disorders. By joining together as individuals
and as a community, the intertwined threads of madness, creativity, and
collaboration can inspire hope and transformation in an oppressive and damaged
world. Participation in The Icarus Project helps us overcome alienation and tap
into the true potential that lies between brilliance and madness.

#### OUR VISION

Together, we seek new space and freedom for extreme states of consciousness. We
support alternatives to the medical model and acknowledge the traumatic legacy
of psychiatric abuse. We recognize that we all live in a crazy world, and
believe that sensitivities, visions, and inspirations are not necessarily
symptoms of illness. Sometimes breakdown can be the entrance to breakthrough. We
call for more options in understanding and treating emotional distress, and we
advocate for everyone, regardless of income, to have access to these choices.
We respect diversity and embrace harm-reduction and self-determination in
treatment decisions. Everyone is welcome, whether they support the use of
psychiatric drugs or not, and whether they identify with diagnostic categories
or not. To ensure we remain honest and untamed, we do not accept funding from
pharmaceutical companies. We invite anyone who shares the Icarus vision and
principles to join us, and choose “The Icarus Project” or any other name for the
independent efforts that inspire them.

#### OUR PRINCIPLES

_Beyond the medical model_ While we respect whatever treatment decisions people
make, we challenge standard definitions of psychic difference as essentially
diseased, disordered, broken, faulty, and existing within the bounds of DSM-IV
diagnosis. We are exploring unknown territory and don’t steer by the default
maps outlined by docs and pharma companies. We’re making new maps.

_Educating ourselves about alternatives_ A lot of what the media, medical
establishment, and institutions tell us about “mental illness,” psych drugs, and
how we have to live our lives is just not true. We educate ourselves and each
other. We question what we hear on TV and read in doctor’s office brochures. We
explore holistic and spiritual approaches to handling our extreme states of
consciousness. We learn as much as we can about any medical treatments, and
encourage each other to make informed choices. Icarus is a sanctuary for people
thinking outside the mainstream and creating their own definitions of health and
wellness.

_Balancing wellness and action_ Icarus is a place for supporting each other in
practicing real self-care. This includes but is not limited to: making sure we
don’t neglect our personal basics like food, rest, exercise, and community;
encouraging each other to commit to the amount of work we can actually do, and
not push ourselves past our limits; and challenging ourselves to find daily
routines and projects that help us live out our dreams and have enough structure
to get by.

_Access_ We don’t need more alternatives that only rich people can afford. All
Icarus gatherings follow the policy that ’no one is turned away for lack of
funds.’ We work to create options and choices that are available to all.

_Non judgment and respect for diversity_ We welcome people who support psych
drugs and people who do not, as well as people who use diagnostic labels and
people who do not identify with those terms. We do not exclude people on the
basis of politics, lifestyle choice, diagnostic history, recreational drug use,
“criminal” behavior, or other outsider identities. We all have a lot to learn
from each other, so we respect each others’ choices. While the current social
system and medical model have the tendency to divide us, we want our
understanding of and experiences with madness to unite us.

_Non-hierarchy and anti-oppression_ Local groups need to be anti-authoritarian,
inclusive, and working against racism/classism/sexism/homophobia and other
oppressions. As a radical mental health support network, our affiliated groups
create safe and challenging spaces where oppressive behavior is not tolerated.

_Nonviolence_ We believe that we will bring about lasting change in the world
through dialogue, compassionate listening, mutual aid, and grassroots networks
of support. We hope these approaches contribute to forming viable alternatives
to the current system of government, bureaucracy, domination, and corporate
culture.

_Transparency_ We believe in public access to information about how we are
making decisions, spending money, distributing responsibility, and otherwise
delegating the work of organizing together. (The Icarus Project, 2005)

These are revolutionary words and acknowledge our relationship to history and
our debt to the movements and cultural workers that have come before us. These
words put us outside all the other organizations working in our field, affirming
to everyone our radical stance in the true meaning of radical: from the roots to
the extremes. No one else in the field of mental health was talking about
non-hierarchy and transparency in this way. We were bringing the radical
narratives and models into the door of the mainstream.

Later that year we created a collective document which we called
_Friends Make the Best Medicine: A Guide to Creating Community Mental Health Support Networks_
that people around the world download from our website and use as a guide for
starting local Icarus Project support groups. Here is part of the introduction.

### Underground roots and magic spells

#### Visions for resisting monoculture and building community

You can see it all from the highway: enormous monocrops of identical corn plants
that reach for miles bordered by an endless sea of strip malls, parking lots,
and tract housing. You can see it on our kitchen counters and in our classrooms:
the same can of soda on the table in Cairo and Kentucky, the same definitions of
“progress” and “freedom” in textbooks around the world. Monoculture – the
practice of replicating a single plant, product or idea over a huge area– is
about the most unstable, unsustainable, unimaginative form of organization that
exists, but in the short term it keeps the system running smoothly and keeps the
power in the hands of a small number of people. In the logic of our modern
world, whether it’s in the farmer’s field or in the high school classroom,
diversity is inefficient and hard to manage. Powerful people figured out awhile
time ago that it’s a lot easier to control things if everyone’s eating the same
foods, listening to the same music, reading the same books, watching the same TV
shows, and speaking the same language. This is what we call the monocult, and
while everyone is supposedly more and more connected by this new “global
culture”, we’re more and more isolated from each other. Things feel more and
more empty, and so many of us end up lonely and rootless, wondering why
everything feels so wrong.

Out in the wild things are very different. In old forests everything is
connected, from the moss and lichens to the ferns and brambles to the birds and
beetles. In our human minds we separate all the parts of the forest into
separate pieces when a lot of the time it can be more helpful to view the forest
as one giant organism with separate parts all working together. The trees of a
forest intertwine their roots and actually communicate with each other
underground. You see it most visibly along ravines and creek beds where a
cut-away hillside reveals totally asymmetrical tangle of roots that no scientist
could ever have imagined or planned out with all his laws of physics. Something
in that tangle explains how those trees can lean out at all kinds of
gravity-defying angles and hang their necks into the strongest winds and still
survive, bending but not breaking, adapting with unpredictable curves and angles
to the way the world breathes and shines and rains and burns. Concrete can’t do
that. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the way life evolves and
gets stronger in the wild. Something about the living architecture of chaos and
time, multi-tiered forests and microscopic algae, outlasts any of the straight
lines and square institutions we’re told to believe in.

We believe that people do not belong in grids and boxes of rootless lonely
monocultures. Humans are adaptable creatures, and while a lot of people learn
to adapt, some of us can’t handle the modern world no matter how many psych
drugs or years of school or behavior modification programs we’ve been put
through. Any realistic model of mental health has to begin by accepting that
there is no standard model for a mind and that none of us are single units
designed for convenience and efficiency. No matter how alienated you are by the
world around you, no matter how out of step or depressed and disconnected you
might feel: you are not alone. Your life is supported by the lives of countless
other beings, from the microbes in your eyelashes to the men who paved your
street. The world is so much more complicated and beautiful than it appears on
the surface.

There are so many of us out here who feel the world with thin skin and heavy
hearts, who get called crazy because we’re too full of fire and pain, who know
that other worlds exist and aren’t comfortable in this version of reality. We’ve
been busting up out of sidewalks and blooming all kind of misfit flowers for as
long as people have been walking on this Earth. So many of us have access to
secret layers of consciousness you could think of us like dandelion roots that
gather minerals from hidden layers of the soil that other plants don’t reach. If
we’re lucky we share them with everyone on the surface―because we feel things
stronger than the other people around us, a lot of us have visions about how
things could be different, why they need to be different, and it’s painful to
keep them silent. Sometimes we get called sick and sometimes we get called
sacred, but no matter how they name us we are a vital part of making this planet
whole.

It’s time we connect our underground roots and tell our buried stories, grow up
strong and scatter our visions all over the patches of scarred and damaged soil
in a society that is so desperately in need of change. (The Icarus Project 2006)

With this statement, we attempted to define ourselves in opposition to the cold
logic of the DSM-IV. The same way that monoculture corn fields are horrible for
the environment but profit a few, the monocultures of the mind are a disaster to
our planet, our communities and personal lives. The Icarus vision, a weaving of
multiple counternarratives, throws the cold DSM narrative on its head and grows
a new world with the broken pieces.

## A dandelion conclusion

Biopsychiatry remains the dominant narrative of mental health despite the fact
that it has faced tremendous resistance. Indeed, over the same years that the
Icarus Project developed, biopsychiatry has become the focus of widespread
critique (Whittaker 2011, Tamini and, Cohen 2008 Lane 2007, Morrison 2005). New
approaches to mental health focus on stories and narratives echoing many of
Icarus Project perspectives and emerging from a variety of sources (Stastny
2007). Yet, despite widespread critique and alternatives, biopsychiatry remains
the invisible common sense on our television screens and in our medical culture.
It is the overwhelming option that is available to us when we and our loved ones
are in distress, and it is the language in our mouths when we try to talk about
our most intimate struggles with our minds. Biopsychiatry is the mainstream that
we all drink from and, for many of us, the story that keeps us feeling trapped
in psychic boxes like we are sick and diseased, rootless and alone.

In the preceding pages I have shared with you the attempts of my community to
actively and creatively counter the biopsychiatric narrative and way of life.
Early on in our struggle, we came up with a metaphorical symbol, an image that
carries a story which best conveys our resilience in the long battle to redefine
how our culture understands mental health. This is the symbol of dandelion roots
and their relationship to soil.

It is a rule of nature that the ground does not stay bare for very long.
Wherever soil has been disturbed, there are always seeds that come along which
grow into plants with roots and leaves that cover the bare soil, providing homes
for all kinds of creatures and enriching the earth through their cycles of life
and death. These plants are called pioneer plants because they lay the
groundwork for the inevitable successions that follow. Many of the most common
pioneer plants are the ones we are trained to see as weeds, plants like the
dandelion whose strong taproot extends far below the depleted topsoil to the
deep layers of subsoil that hold hidden minerals underground. The dandelion
pulls these minerals up and incorporates them into its leaves and flowers; when
it dies all the nutrients that were locked underground join the upper layers of
soil, making them available to the next generation of plants growing in the
soil.

We have learned, in the Icarus Project, to see the dandelion–this wild and
unpredictable plant that reaches into the fertile darkness of underground
places–as a symbol for our work. Many of the ideas from the Icarus Project are
taken from the cultural and political underground, from important stories and
wisdom that are not so easy to find in the topsoil of mainstream culture. Many
of our visions for the future emerge from the depths of our own experiences as
the mad ones whose roots reach down into the darkness but whose voices open up
into the light.

Pioneer plants tend to create thousands of tiny seeds that are lightweight,
sometimes with fine hairs that act like parachutes, keeping them afloat in the
wind and preventing them from succumbing too quickly to gravity. We see the
Icarus Project setting seed and releasing messages from hidden worlds that just
might travel far and wide and colonize patches of damaged soil all over the
planet, slowly transforming old stories into new, laying the groundwork for
inevitable changes. In this spirit, the dandelion serves as an organic metaphor
for our strategy and our vigilant hope going into the future.
