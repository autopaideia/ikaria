## Abstract

Psychiatric frameworks are used as the primary lens in the Western world to
understand, define, describe, and categorize the experience of mental distress
in individuals. The Icarus Project is a community mental health organization
that has a focus on intersectionality and uses a social justice lens to look at
experiences of mental distress. Members of The Icarus Project believe that they
possess knowledge about the potential benefits that exist in the space between
brilliance and madness as a community of individuals with lived experience of
mental distress. Members believe that, through this knowledge, they can instill
a sense of hope and inspiration for those who experience distress and suffering,
which they argue is often due to social injustices and inequities. Using
Foucaultian Discourse Analysis (FDA) this research examines four documents
published by The Icarus Project. The research question for this research project
is twofold. The first research question is: to what extent does The Icarus
Project rely on psychiatry? The second research question is: how is “expertise”
defined by The Icarus Project? How does The Icarus Project mobilize this
expertise? The results from this analysis demonstrate that while the
publications created by The Icarus Project use language that challenges dominant
psychiatric paradigms about “mental illness” and what it means to experience
emotional distress and suffering. The documents produced by The Icarus Project
demonstrate the organizations effort to create space for people who accept
psychiatric paradigms and those who do not. The documents reviewed for this
project also demonstrate the commitment of the members of The Icarus Project’s
work to create new and better healing spaces by distributing knowledge generated
by people who have experience with madness themselves. Promoting the expertise
of those with lived experience of madness is a central focus of the project. The
Icarus Project provides an example of how people with lived experience can
generate and distribute their knowledge and share it with others in similar
circumstances. However, there are still opportunities for the project to
increase the accessibility of the language used in their documents as well as
highlight more clearly the intersection of race and distress, and to clearly
articulate the project’s definition of expertise. The Icarus Project
demonstrates that biomedical models of mental distress are not the only
available discourse and that we can think about distress, and in turn healing,
differently.
