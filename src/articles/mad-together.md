## Abstract

This dissertation describes concerns associated with the technologization of
madness and instances when people with diverse mental states engage with
technology to participate in the more-than-human world. Drawing from field
notes, visual data, and interviews I collected in a multi-sited ethnography, I
argue that technology can shape an individual’s environ(mental) niche, bring
people together, and create a sense of solidarity through sharing lived
experiences within posthuman emotional ecologies. Paradoxically, such tools are
unstable themselves: they can create volatile spaces in which people feel
further alienated and fragmented as their “symptoms” of mental illness are
performed publicly. Noting the many iterations of The Icarus Project in digital
and analog spheres and my engagements with those involved, I also articulate the
internal logics and contradictions within neoliberal forces that push
individuals within the organization to perform particular economic rationalities
in preparation for the seemingly inevitable collapse of their own mental states
and of the group’s functioning as a whole. Finally, I ask how we might begin to
acknowledge the complexities of madness and loss in ways that do not further
reify heroic—yet admittedly problematic—narratives of risk and resilience.
