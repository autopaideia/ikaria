This Zine is a collaborative work by Icarus Project members. In expressing our
feelings, insights, and ideas about madness and the world around us we hope to
inform and inspire others. The stories told by the psychiatric establishment,
pharmaceutical industry, and the mainstream media all to often overshadow our
own. By sharing our stories with others we can reclaim the right to define
ourselves and our experiences. We choose to honor our uniqueness and complexity
by letting our voices be heard. We seek understanding and openness in a culture
far to prone to label and judge.
