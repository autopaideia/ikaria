This 52-page guide gathers the best information we've come across and the most
valuable lessons we've learned about reducing and coming off psychiatric
medication. Includes information on mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics,
anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, risks, benefits, wellness tools,
withdrawal, support for people staying on their medications, a detailed Resource
section, and much more. It emphasizes years of direct personal experience with
medications and the experiences of madness they are prescribed to treat, as well
as extensive, state-of-the-art research that goes far beyond the usual
pharmaceutical and mainstream medical perspectives.
